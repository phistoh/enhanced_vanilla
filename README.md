# Enhanced Vanilla datapack
A collection of datapacks which "enhance" the vanilla Minecraft experience

## Description of modules
* `days_since_death`: This datapack keeps track of the world age (in days) and of the number of days since the player last died. The datapack shows both statistics each morning as a title to the player. It also stores the longest survival streak in a scoreboard.
* `lose_xp`:
* `one_player_sleep`
* `potion_of_recall`:
* `vanilla_tweaks`:
